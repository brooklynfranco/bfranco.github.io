<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>4th & 10 Apparel is family owned and operated out of Syracuse, Utah. We wanted a company that created quality team apparel without all the hassel. After going through different vendors and being unsatisfied we decided to do it ourselves.  </p>
    <p> At 4th & 10 Apparel, we try our best to make ordering team gear a seamless process. We pride ourselves on creating quality products, quality personal customer service and reasonable turn-around times. Most of all, we want our customers to be able to represent their teams with pride.
    </p>

<h3>Our Name</h3>
	<p>This dream for a local t-shirt printing company was established long before 2020. Our founder, Art Franco, grew up in Salt Lake City on 4th and 10. </p>
